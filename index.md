## Projects

- **IMU Project**: [Repo Link](https://github.com/mahdishahsavar/project1)  
  Designed and programmed a new IMU board featuring an STM32 ARM processor, LoRa modules for communication, a barometer, a temperature sensor, and two accelerometers for varying acceleration ranges. The ARM was programmed in an embedded C++ environment, utilizing RTOS, I2C, and UART serial communication protocols for the modules. The PCB was designed using Altium Designer.

- **Underground UWB Positioning Module**: [Repo Link](https://github.com/mahdishahsavar/project1)  
  Designed and built a gas monitoring system for underground tunnels, utilizing multiple gas sensors and a board equipped with an AVR microcontroller. This setup collects sensor data using I2C and then transmits it via a UART serial connection to a computer for analysis.
  
- **Underground CO2 Monitoring**: [Repo Link](https://github.com/mahdishahsavar/project1)  
  Designed and built a gas monitoring system for underground tunnels, utilizing multiple gas sensors and a board equipped with an AVR microcontroller. This setup collects sensor data using I2C and then transmits it via a UART serial connection to a computer for analysis.

- **Excavator**: [Repo Link](https://github.com/mahdishahsavar/project1)  
  Designed and built a small scale of a real excavator for remote control and fully immersive teleoperation.

- **Manipulator projects**: [Repo Link](https://github.com/mahdishahsavar/project1)  
  - Programmed a 6-DOF manipulator mounted on a rover to sand the exterior of boats (simulation).  
  - Programmed a 6-DOF Doosan A0509 manipulator. Collaborated with Nvidia Jetson, Depth Camera, and 2D/3D LiDars.
