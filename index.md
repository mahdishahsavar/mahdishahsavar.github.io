## Work Experience

- **Software/Firmware/Hardware Researcher**, University of Nevada, Reno (Oct 2021–Present)  
  - Developed and maintained embedded firmware for multiple IoT devices, focusing on real-time data acquisition and wireless communication (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and RF LoRa).  
  - Implemented efficient RTOS-based scheduling and interrupt handling to ensure stable system performance.  
  - Designed and built various PCBs; performed bare-metal ARM programming using STM32Cube and Segger Embedded Studio.
  - Utilized ESP32, ARM, and AVR microcontrollers across diverse hardware designs.

- **Embedded Software Engineer**, Sundance DSP Inc (Oct 2024 – Dec 2024)  
  - Developed firmware for a RISC-V SoC using Buildroot and Yocto.  
  - Programming FPGA for real-time image processing.  

- **Firmware/Hardware Engineer**, Farmed Tajhiz (May 2017 – Jun 2019)  
  - Designed and tested custom PCB solutions, integrating microcontrollers (AVR, ARM) and peripheral sensors for industrial projects.  
  - Programmed in C and C++ for real-time applications, implementing UART, CAN, I2C, and SPI for sensor data collection.  
  - Optimized existing firmware to improve reliability and reduce power consumption.
    
- **Firmware/Hardware Teacher and Freelance Engineer**, Tehran, Iran (Jun 2012 – Dec 2019)  
  - Work as a Robotic (Hardware and Firmware) teacher, Mentoring teams for different competitions or making new patents.   
  - Working freelance on projects from helping them with developing the idea, designing the circuit, building the hardware, and doing the firmware mostly with the help of ARM and AVR microcontrollers.

## Projects

- **IMU Project**: [Repo Link](https://github.com/mahdishahsavar/project1)  
  Designed and programmed a new IMU board featuring an STM32 ARM processor, LoRa modules for communication, a barometer, a temperature sensor, and two accelerometers for varying acceleration ranges. The ARM was programmed in an embedded C++ environment, utilizing RTOS, I2C, and UART serial communication protocols for the modules. The PCB was designed using Altium Designer.

- **Underground UWB Positioning Module**: [Repo Link](https://github.com/mahdishahsavar/project1)  
  Designed and built a gas monitoring system for underground tunnels, utilizing multiple gas sensors and a board equipped with an AVR microcontroller. This setup collects sensor data using I2C and then transmits it via a UART serial connection to a computer for analysis.
  
- **Underground CO2 Monitoring**: [Repo Link](https://github.com/mahdishahsavar/project1)  
  Designed and built a gas monitoring system for underground tunnels, utilizing multiple gas sensors and a board equipped with an AVR microcontroller. This setup collects sensor data using I2C and then transmits it via a UART serial connection to a computer for analysis.

- **Excavator**: [Repo Link](https://github.com/mahdishahsavar/project1)  
  Designed and built a small scale of a real excavator for remote control and fully immersive teleoperation.

- **Manipulator projects**: [Repo Link](https://github.com/mahdishahsavar/project1)  
  - Programmed a 6-DOF manipulator mounted on a rover to sand the exterior of boats (simulation).  
  - Programmed a 6-DOF Doosan A0509 manipulator. Collaborated with Nvidia Jetson, Depth Camera, and 2D/3D LiDars.
